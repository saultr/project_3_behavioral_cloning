# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Overview
---
This repository contains the files for my solution to the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, I will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

This project makes use of a Udacity-developed driving simulator and training data collected from the simulator (neither of which is included in this repo) to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

The project include four files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* video.py (script to convert captured images from the driving into a video)
This README file describes how to output the video in the "Details About Files In This Directory" section.


The Project
---
The goals of this repository are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The simulator can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)


## Approach

### Base Model and Adjustments

The project instructions from Udacity suggest starting from a known self-driving car model and provided a link to the nVidia model (and later in the student forum, the comma.ai model) - the diagram below is a depiction of the nVidia model architecture.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
